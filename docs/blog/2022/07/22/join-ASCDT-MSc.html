<p>Interested in joining the lab?</p>

<p>A fully funded studentship (for UK/EU) is available through the Warwick Centre for Doctoral Training in Analytical Science (ASCDT) Msc + PhD route for October 2022 entry. In this 4-year programme, you will take a selection of courses and pick two mini-projects for the first year, which leads to the award of a MSc in Analytical Sciences. After that, you choose one of your mini-projects to continue for a PhD.</p>

<p>We are offering a project titled <strong>Developing a solid-state NMR approach to characterise coatings and scaffolds that support mammalian cell culture</strong>.</p>

<p>Description: Mammalian cell culture is an essential technology for biomedical research and development of personalized medicine. Cell growth and development are strongly influenced by the molecular structures present in the extracellular environment, which is provided currently by coatings, scaffolds and gels, which can show variation due to batch and preparation method. Better characterisation of the intact extracellular environment will enable the design of a new generation of materials to support mammalian cell culture for well-defined outcomes. In this mini-project, you will have the chance to learn solid-state NMR and other analytical and structural characterization techniques. You will apply these techniques to scaffolds and gels that you have prepared. Depending on interest, you may also produce samples by mammalian cell culture yourself, gaining a key skill for many areas of biotechnological industry in the process.</p>

<p>Other projects can be viewed at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/as/study/msc/">ASCDT page for the MSc + PhD route</a>. You can also find more information about the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/as/about/">Analytical Science Centre for Doctoral Training (ASCDT)</a>.</p>

<p>Deadline: 15 August 2022</p>
