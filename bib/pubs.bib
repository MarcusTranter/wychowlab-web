   abstract = {Solid-state NMR spectroscopy (ssNMR) with magic-angle spinning (MAS) enables the investigation of biological systems within their native context, such as lipid membranes, viral capsid assemblies, and cells. However, such ambitious investigations often suffer from low sensitivity due to the presence of significant amounts of other molecular species, which reduces the effective concentration of the biomolecule or interaction of interest. Certain investigations requiring the detection of very low concentration species remain unfeasible even with increasing experimental time for signal averaging. By applying dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to overcome the sensitivity challenge, the experimental time required can be reduced by orders of magnitude, broadening the feasible scope of applications for biological solid-state NMR. In this review, we outline strategies commonly adopted for biological applications of DNP, indicate ongoing challenges, and present a comprehensive overview of biological investigations where MAS-DNP has led to unique insights.},

No molecular mechanism links elevated HGA to ochronosis; the pigment's chemical identity is still not known, nor how it induces joint cartilage degradation. Here we give key insight on HGA-derived pigment composition and collagen disruption in AKU cartilage. Synthetic pigment and pigmented human cartilage tissue both showed hydroquinone-resembling NMR signals. EPR spectroscopy showed that the synthetic pigment contains radicals. Moreover, we observed intrastrand disruption of collagen triple helix in pigmented AKU human cartilage, and in cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. We propose that collagen degradation can occur via transient glycyl radicals, the formation of which is enhanced in AKU due to the redox environment generated by pigmentation.},

abstract = {In pilot studies of the usefulness of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in characterizing chemical and molecular structural effects of alkaptonuria on connective tissue, we have obtained (13) C spectra from articular cartilage from an AKU patient. An apparently normal anatomical location yielded a cross polarization magic angle spinning spectrum resembling literature spectra and dominated by collagen and glycosaminoglycan signals. All spectral linewidths from strongly pigmented ochronotic cartilage however were considerably increased relative to the control indicating a marked increase in collagen molecular disorder. This disordering of cartilage structural protein parallels, at the atomic level, the disordering revealed at higher length scales by microscopy. We also demonstrate that the abnormal spectra from ochronotic cartilage fit with the abnormality in the structure of collagen fibres at the ultrastructural level, whereby large ochronotic deposits appear to alter the structure of the collagen fibre by invasion and cross linking. Summary: Increased signal linewidths in solid state NMR spectra of ochronotic articular cartilage from an AKU patient relative to linewidths in normal, control, cartilage reveals a marked decrease in collagen molecular order in the diseased tissue. This atomic level disordering parallels higher length scale disorder revealed by microscopic techniques.},

abstract = {Biomineralization of the extracellular matrix is an essential, regulated process. Inappropriate mineralization of bone and the vasculature has devastating effects on patient health, yet an integrated understanding of the chemical and cell biological processes that lead to mineral nucleation remains elusive. Here, we report that biomineralization of bone and the vasculature is associated with extracellular poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases in response to oxidative and/or DNA damage. We use ultrastructural methods to show poly(ADP-ribose) can form both calcified spherical particles, reminiscent of those found in vascular calcification, and biomimetically calcified collagen fibrils similar to bone. Importantly, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo inhibits biomineralization, suggesting a therapeutic route for the treatment of vascular calcifications. We conclude that poly(ADP-ribose) plays a central chemical role in both pathological and physiological extracellular matrix calcification. M{\"{u}}ller et al. investigate the physicochemical process of extracellular matrix calcification in both physiological (bone) and pathological (vascular calcification) contexts. They find that oxidative stress-induced poly(ADP-ribose) nucleates calcium phosphate mineral crystals on extracellular matrix substrates and that calcification is inhibited by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme inhibitors.},

abstract = {Fibrillar collagens have mechanical and biological roles, providing tissues with both tensile strength and cell binding sites which allow molecular interactions with cell-surface receptors such as integrins. A key question is: how do collagens allow tissue flexibility whilst maintaining well-defined ligand binding sites? Here we show that proline residues in collagen glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (Gly-Pro-Hyp) triplets provide local conformational flexibility, which in turn confers well-defined, low energy molecular compression-extension and bending, by employing two-dimensional 13C-13C correlation NMR spectroscopy on 13C-labelled intact ex vivo bone and in vitro osteoblast extracellular matrix. We also find that the positions of Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets are highly conserved between animal species, and are spatially clustered in the currently-accepted model of molecular ordering in collagen type I fibrils. We propose that the Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets in fibrillar collagens provide fibril “expansion joints” to maintain molecular ordering within the fibril, thereby preserving the structural integrity of ligand binding sites.},

abstract = {NMR is ideal for characterizing non-enzymatic protein glycation, including AGEs (advanced glycation end products) underlying tissue pathologies in diabetes and ageing. Ribose, ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and ADP-ribose (ADPR) could be significant and underinvestigated biological glycating agents especially in chronic inflammation. Using [U-13C]ribose we have identified a novel glycoxidation adduct, 5-deoxy-5-desmethylpronyl-lysine, "norpronyl-lysine", as well as numerous free ketones, acids, and amino group reaction products. Glycation by R5P and ADPR proceeds rapidly, with R5P generating a brown precipitate with PLL within hours. Solid state NMR (ssNMR) 13C-13C correlation spectroscopy identifies several crosslinking adducts such as the newly identified norpronyl-lysine, in situ, from the glycating reaction of 13C5-ribose with collagen. The same adducts are also identifiable after reaction of collagen with R5P. We also demonstrate for the first time bio-amine (spermidine, N-acetyl lysine, poly-L-lysine (PLL)) catalyzed ribose 2-epimerization to arabinose at physiological pH. This work raises the prospect of advancing understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of glycation in actual tissues, in vitro or even ex vivo, using NMR isotope-labelled glycating agents, without analyses requiring chemical or enzymatic degradations, or prior assumptions about glycation products.},

abstract = {Collagens, the most abundant proteins in mammals, are defined by their triple-helical structures and distinctive Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating sequence, where Xaa is often proline and Yaa, hydroxyproline (Hyp/O). It is known that hydroxyproline in the Yaa position stabilises the triple helix, and that lack of proline hydroxylation in vivo leads to dysfunctional collagen extracellular matrix assembly, due to a range of factors such as a change in hydration properties. In addition, we note that in model peptides, when Yaa is unmodified proline, the Xaa proline has a strong propensity to adopt an endo ring conformation, whilst when Yaa is hydroxyproline, the Xaa proline adopts a range of endo and exo conformations. Here we use a combination of solid-state NMR spectroscopy and potential energy landscape modelling of synthetic triple-helical collagen peptides to understand this effect. We show that hydroxylation of the Yaa proline causes the Xaa proline ring conformation to become metastable, which in turn confers flexibility on the triple helix.},
