title: Pigmentation in alkaptonuria
#status: inactive

description: |
   Alkaptonuria is a rare disease that can lead to servere pigmentation of various body tissues, which is associated with tissue degradation. While visually striking, the chemical nature of the pigment is still not well-understood. By characterizing in vitro-generated pigment using a variety of chemical techniques, we aim to understand the nature of the pigmentation species and illuminate new clinical approaches to prevent or reverse its formation.
